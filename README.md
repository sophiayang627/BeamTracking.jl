This package provides routines for simulating charged particle beams. 

To develop this package:

```julia
import Pkg;
Pkg.develop(url="https://github.com/bmad-sim/BeamTracking.jl.git"); # This package! Replace bmad-sim with your username if working on a fork
```

If working on your own fork, replace `bmad-sim` in the above `develop` url with your Github username.

In your `~/.julia/dev/` directory, you will now see the directory `BeamTracking`. This is the Github repo where you can do your work and push changes.
